# Susbscription-Pricing-Webpage

Hey, I am excited to share with you that I had finally developed a webpage using Bootstrap Framework, first time in my life.

I engineered this "Pricing Webpage" which displays pricing of different monthly subscription plans.

I developed this webpage using technologies: HTML & CSS (Bootstrap)

I learned about different layouts, components, forms with different classes in Bootstrap framework and used grid layout, flex layout, button & card components and margin utilities to engineer this webpage.

It was so much fun to build this good-looking webpage so quickly and easily using Bootstrap framework instead of defining the CSS rules on my own.
