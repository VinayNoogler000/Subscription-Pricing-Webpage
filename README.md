# Subscription-Pricing-Webpage

## Overview:
Hi Techy, I am excited to share with you that I had developed a Subscription Pricing Webpage, which displays pricing of different monthly subscription plans.

## Tech Info:
I developed this webpage using technologies: **HTML, CSS & Tailwind framework**.

## Note:
In this repo, the **bootstrap** branch contains those code/files, which were used to develop this _Pricing Webpage_, by using **Bootstrap framework**, wheread, the **tailwind** branch contains those code/files (in the _src_ folder), which were used to develop this webpage, by using **Tailwind CSS framework**.

## Development Journey:
- I learned about different utility classes related to Typography, Layout, Flexbox, Spacing, Sizing, Backgrounds, Borders and Transitions in Tailwind CSS framework and used them to engineer this webpage. 
- I made this webpage responsize, by using Tailwind's breakpoints prefix.
- I have implemented modifiers, like `:hover` with the utility classes, to make the user experience better.
- I have also learnt about customizing the default Tailwind CSS's styling, by using
'tailwind.config.js', and directives like, @layer & @apply, in our own custom CSS file. 

## Conclusion:
It was so much fun to build this good-looking webpage so quickly and easily using Tailwind framework instead of defining the time-consuming CSS rules on my own.
