# Susbscription-Pricing-Webpage

## Overview:
Hey, I am excited to share with you that I had finally developed a webpage, first time in my life, named as "Pricing Webpage" which displays pricing of different monthly subscription plans.

## Tech Info:
I developed this webpage using technologies: HTML & CSS (Bootstrap)

## Note:
In this repo, the **bootstrap** branch contains those code/files, which were used to develop this _Pricing Webpage_, by using **Bootstrap framework**, wheread, the **tailwind** branch contains those code/files (in the _src_ folder), which were used to develop this webpage, by using **Tailwind CSS framework**.

## Development Journey:
I learned about different layouts, components, forms with different classes in Bootstrap framework and used grid layout, flex layout, button & card components and margin utilities to engineer this webpage.

## Conclusion:
It was so much fun to build this good-looking webpage so quickly and easily using Bootstrap framework instead of defining the CSS rules on my own.
